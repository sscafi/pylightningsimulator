# Lightning Formation Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates the formation of lightning using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter and animations created with Matplotlib. The animation visually represents the different stages of lightning formation, including the appearance of cumulonimbus clouds, the leader formation, and the return stroke

## Features

- Visualization of cumulonimbus clouds
- Animated representation of electrical charge separation
- Simulation of lightning leader and return stroke
- Interactive GUI using Tkinter

## Requirements

To run this simulation, you'll need to have the following Python packages installed:

- `tkinter` (usually included with standard Python installations)
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
